# collections

This is the collections repository, which contains
small programs written in a multitude of different
programming languages.

The purpose of this project is to have a place where
new programmers can view examples to learn new concepts
in the language they are taking up.

I feel that the best way to learn how to code is to read code.

Also, maintaining a full-on learning or reference website is hard,
but this project is easier to maintain and still holds the same
purpose.

This repository started as the miniprograms
which used to be hosted in [samrpf/samrpf](https://github.com/samrpf/samrpf).
