# old-miniprograms

These are the miniprograms which used to be hosted in
[samrpf/samrpf](https://github.com/samrpf/samrpf).

You can always find out more about this by looking at the commit history
of the above listed repository.

## Wait, some of them are gone!

That's because they didn't need to be here in the
MiniPrograms folder.

For example, I already have repls and resositories
for TextAdventure.cpp and NumberGuesser.cpp.

## Why don't any of the folder names have symbols in them?

MiniPrograms was made to be web-safe, so that all MiniPrograms could
easily be accessed over the internet through
`https://samrpf.github.io/samrpf/MiniPrograms/(language)/(filename)`.

The reason why I did this is because I hosted my GitHub Pages
site through the `samrpf/samrpf` repository, and people wouldn't
want to go to GitHub just to look at my code!

And this way, I could just link to `MiniPrograms/(language)/(filename)`
when I'm on the homepage and people will easily be able to see it!

Even though I forgot to include the MiniPrograms folder in `_config.yml`,
and I'd still have to link to `raw.githubusercontent.com` for it to work...

(I seriously have no idea what I was thinking...)

## Ummmm... How do you feel about these MiniPrograms?

`MiniPrograms/Golang/Loops.go:2`

## Some of them still say `samrcode on GitHub`.

I stopped working on the MiniPrograms a while ago.

## Why are you keeping these instead of deleting them?

I feel that having a collection of small programs written
in a specific language can help new programmers learn
how to program in that language.

I'm only keeping these because I want to make a place
where learners can refer to if they ever need help with a new concept.

It's eaiser to maintain than a full-on learning or reference website,
but it still holds the same purpose and can do the same things.

## Will you ever add any more MiniPrograms?

idk. I might rename the repository to something different
and start and really take on the "learning place" direction that
I talked about above.

Until I decide to take on that, I'll just make small changes every now and then and
maybe delete some things and add others.

## ... human.py? human.cpp? Human.cs?
