# collections

This repository started as the miniprograms
which used to be hosted in [samrpf/samrpf](https://github.com/samrpf/samrpf).

Please see commit history for more info while I figure out
how to write a proper README.

## Why are you keeping these instead of deleting them?

I feel that having a collection of small programs written
in a specific language can help new programmers learn
how to program in that language.

I'm only keeping these because I want to make a place
where learners can refer to if they ever need help with a new concept.

It's eaiser to maintain than a full-on learning or reference website,
but it still holds the same purpose and can do the same things.
